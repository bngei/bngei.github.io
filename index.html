                        <p>This AI project involves coordinating two agents to transport blocks from pickup to dropoff cells. It explores two reinforcement learning approaches: individual strategies for each agent considering the other's position and a joint strategy moving both agents together. Strategies employ policies like random, exploit, and greedy actions, aiming to optimize block transportation while addressing constraints like alternate moves and blockage avoidance.</p>

                        <p>The virtual colonoscopy project employs advanced Python algorithms to process CT images, aiming to identify colon abnormalities such as polyps or cancerous tumors. Emulating CT scanner functions in diverse orientations, it constructs a virtual phantom for precise tumor placement. Through image slicing and adjustable parameters, users collect projections and conduct detailed analyses, resulting in accurate image reconstruction and precise tumor localization.</p>
